### Favorite Labs From CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was a favorite because it included a fun element of
    getting to see the random input be entered into the code. This lab
    taught us the basics of user input and how we can print it out to
    form new phrases. This code also introduced us to the proper formatting
    used to print out our messages.

* Lab 6
    
    Lab 6, part 2 was another favorite because it dealt with using
    arguments and determining if the program can run with the correct
    amount of arguments. This also introduced the game of blackjack which
    was fun to work with. Using these card rules and values, we were able to 
    create use bool and other variables to determine to outcome of the games.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was also a favorite because it introduced the push back and get
    line commands and used them to read files in order to get the proper information
    about the pizzas. On top of these variables, we also used vectors in order to 
    gather the correct data on price and calories.
